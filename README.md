# TSP Solver: Simulated Annealing & Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

2 enhanced implementations of SA and GA metaheuristic algorithms that aim to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). <br>
Task: attempts to give the solution of the shortest possible route to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city. 

| Algorithm | Code | Tariff | Basic | Enhanced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Simulated Annealing** | SA | 5 | `AlgAbasic.py` | `AlgAenhanced.py` |
| **Genetic Algorithm** | GA | 6 | `AlgBbasic.py` | `AlgBenhanced.py` |

## TSP Solver Algorithms 

#### AlgAbasic.py -- BASIC SA 

- Standard SA with random initial tour generation and 2-opt neighbourhood moves
- Accepts worse solutions probabilistically based on a cooling temperature schedule
 
#### AlgAenhanced.py -- ENHANCED SA

- Nearest-neighbour heuristic for initial tour construction
- Multiple neighbourhood operators: 2-opt, node insertion, and Or-opt moves
- Adaptive neighbourhood selection that favours operators producing improvements

#### AlgBbasic.py -- BASIC GA

- Standard GA with random population initialisation, tournament selection
- As well as order crossover (OX), and swap mutation

#### AlgBenhanced.py -- ENHANCED GA

- Population seeded with nearest-neighbour heuristic tours
- Additional inversion mutation operator alongside swap mutation
- Adaptive mutation strategy
- 2-opt local search applied to offspring for hybrid GA approach

## How to use

To use an algorithm to attempt to find the shortest possible route of a city dataset:

```bash
cd ttsh43_for_submission                                   # cd into folder
python AlgAbasic.py ../city-files/AISearchfile042.txt      # run [select alg] on [select dataset]
```

## Algorithm Results

Running the above generates a solution file that details the shortest route the algorithm COULD find. <br>
There are (2 enhanced algorithms * 10 city datasets) pre-generated solution files. <br>
These are found inside ttsh43_for_submission.
